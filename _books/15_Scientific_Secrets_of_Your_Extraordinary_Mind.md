## About The Book

Science and the human mind have a perennial connection. Implementation techniques of simple laws of science elevate the mind to a superior status. If you are someone who has been feeling inferior to the contemporaries who have raced ahead; someone bogged down by problems related to health and wealth; someone with strained relationships; someone with umpteen cases of misfortune; someone with broken dreams and unfulfilled desires, "15 Scientific Secrets Of Your Extraordinary Mind Is For You". This book is for the black sheep, the Odd Ducks, the rejects, the eccentrics, the loners, the lost and forgotten, the defeated souls and a lot more.
